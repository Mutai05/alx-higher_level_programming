# Test case 1: 2x2 matrix multiplication
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Test case 2: 1x2 and 2x2 matrix multiplication
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]])

# Test case 3: Empty matrices (should raise ValueError)
>>> matrix_mul([], [])

ValueError: m_a can't be empty and m_b can't be empty

# Test case 4: Matrices with non-integer/float elements (should raise TypeError)
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 'a']], [['b', 4], [5, 6]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats and m_b should contain only integers or floats

# Test case 5: Non-rectangular matrices (should raise TypeError)
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3]], [[4, 5], [6, 7]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: each row of m_a must be of the same size and each row of m_b must be of the same size

# Test case 6: Matrices incompatible for multiplication (should raise ValueError)
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied
