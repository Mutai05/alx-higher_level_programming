**How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script:**
To connect to a MySQL database from a Python script, you can use the `mysql-connector` library. First, install it:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Now, you can use it in your script:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host",
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

# Create a cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute SQL queries

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

Replace "your_host," "your_user," "your_password," and "your_database" with your MySQL server details.

**How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script:**
```python
import mysql.connector

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host",
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute SELECT query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")

# Fetch all rows
rows = cursor.fetchall()

for row in rows:
    print(row)

cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

**How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script:**
```python
import mysql.connector

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host",
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute INSERT query
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)", ("value1", "value2"))

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

Replace "your_table," "column1," "column2," "value1," and "value2" with your table and column names and values.

**What ORM means:**
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that allows interaction with relational databases using object-oriented programming languages. ORM frameworks, like SQLAlchemy in Python, facilitate the mapping of database tables to Python classes, enabling developers to work with databases using objects.

**How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table:**
Using SQLAlchemy as an example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, MetaData
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class YourTable(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'your_table'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    column1 = Column(String)
    column2 = Column(String)

# Create an engine and bind it to the metadata of the Base class
engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://your_user:your_password@your_host/your_database')
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

Replace "YourTable," "your_table," "column1," "column2," "your_user," "your_password," "your_host," and "your_database" with your specific details.

**How to create a Python Virtual Environment:**
To create a Python virtual environment, use the following commands:

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv

# On macOS or Linux
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS or Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now, your terminal prompt should change, indicating that the virtual environment is active. You can install packages within this environment without affecting your system-wide Python installation. To deactivate the virtual environment, use the command:

```bash
deactivate
```
