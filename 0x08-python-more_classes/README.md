### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
OOP is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than just functions and procedures. It involves structuring code to revolve around objects that contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions that operate on the data). Python supports OOP and makes it easy to implement.

### "First-class everything":
In Python, everything (objects, functions, classes, etc.) is treated as an object, meaning they can be dynamically created, assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from functions.

### Class and Object:
- **Class**: A blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class should have.
- **Object/Instance**: An instance of a class. It's a concrete realization of the class, holding its own unique data and able to perform actions defined by the class.

### Difference between Class and Object/Instance:
A class is a blueprint that defines the structure, while an object or instance is a concrete entity created from that blueprint.

### Attribute:
An attribute is a piece of data stored within an object. It could be a variable attached to a class or an instance.

### Public, Protected, and Private Attributes:
- **Public**: Accessible from outside the class.
- **Protected** (denoted by a single underscore `_` convention): Intended for internal use but can be accessed in derived classes.
- **Private** (denoted by a double underscore `__` prefix): Intended to be used within the class only.

### `self`:
`self` is a convention in Python that represents the instance itself within a class. It's the first parameter of instance methods and refers to the instance invoking the method.

### Method:
A method is a function defined inside a class that operates on the instance of the class.

### `__init__` method:
It's a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes.

### Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding:
- **Abstraction**: Showing essential features and hiding implementation details.
- **Encapsulation**: Binding data and methods that manipulate that data together to restrict direct access from outside the class.
- **Information Hiding**: Restricting access to certain parts of an object, often achieved through encapsulation.

### Property:
A property allows controlling the access to an attribute, enabling validation, computation, or setting conditions when accessing or modifying an attribute.

### Difference between Attribute and Property:
An attribute is a piece of data stored within an object, while a property is a mechanism to manage attribute access.

### Pythonic way to write getters and setters:
Use the `@property`, `@<attribute>.setter`, and `@<attribute>.deleter` decorators to define getters, setters, and deleters for properties.

### `__str__` and `__repr__` methods:
- `__str__`: Returns a human-readable string representation of the object and is invoked by the `str()` function.
- `__repr__`: Returns a string representation that, if possible, should be a valid Python expression to recreate the object. Invoked by the `repr()` function.

### Class Attribute vs. Object Attribute:
- **Class Attribute**: Belongs to the class itself and is shared among all instances.
- **Object Attribute**: Belongs to a specific instance of the class.

### Class Method and Static Method:
- **Class Method**: A method that is bound to the class rather than the instance and can access class variables and modify class state.
- **Static Method**: A method that does not have access to the instance or class and behaves like a regular function but is defined within a class for organization purposes.

### Dynamically creating attributes:
Use the dot notation or `setattr(instance, 'attribute_name', value)` to create attributes dynamically for instances.

### Binding attributes to objects and classes:
Attributes can be bound directly by assignment (`object.attribute = value`) or by using the `setattr()` function for dynamic assignment.

### `__dict__` of a class and instance:
- `__dict__` of a class: Contains the namespace of the class, including its attributes, methods, etc.
- `__dict__` of an instance: Contains the instance's attributes and their values.

### Python attribute lookup:
Python looks for attributes first in the instance's namespace, then in the class, and then in its inheritance chain.

### Using `getattr()` function:
`getattr(object, 'attribute_name')` retrieves the value of the specified attribute of an object.

These concepts form the backbone of object-oriented programming in Python, providing a flexible and powerful way to structure and manage code.
