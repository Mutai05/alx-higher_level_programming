1. **What’s a database:**
   - A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way to be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It can store various types of information, and its purpose is to provide an efficient and organized method for retrieving and managing that data.

2. **What’s a relational database:**
   - A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure that allows relationships to be established between different tables. These relationships are based on common fields in those tables. This structure enables efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data.

3. **What does SQL stand for:**
   - SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is used for tasks such as querying data, updating data, and defining the structure of a database.

4. **What’s MySQL:**
   - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is widely used for managing and manipulating databases and is known for its reliability, scalability, and ease of use.

5. **How to create a database in MySQL:**
   - To create a database in MySQL, you can use the following SQL command:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE database_name;
     ```

6. **What does DDL and DML stand for:**
   - DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It includes SQL commands used for defining and managing the structure of a database, such as creating tables and altering their structure.
   - DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It includes SQL commands used for manipulating data within a database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.

7. **How to CREATE or ALTER a table:**
   - To create a table, you can use the following SQL command:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column1 datatype1,
       column2 datatype2,
       ...
     );
     ```
   - To alter a table, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement with various options to modify the table structure.

8. **How to SELECT data from a table:**
   - To select data from a table, you can use the SELECT statement:
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2, ...
     FROM table_name
     WHERE condition;
     ```

9. **How to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data:**
   - To insert data into a table:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
     VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
     ```
   - To update data in a table:
     ```sql
     UPDATE table_name
     SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
     WHERE condition;
     ```
   - To delete data from a table:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM table_name
     WHERE condition;
     ```

10. **What are subqueries:**
    - A subquery is a query nested within another query. It can be used to retrieve data that will be used by the main query. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and other parts of a SQL statement.

11. **How to use MySQL functions:**
    - MySQL provides a variety of built-in functions that can be used for data manipulation, calculations, and other operations. Examples include COUNT, SUM, AVG, CONCAT, etc. You can use them in your SQL queries to perform specific tasks.

These concepts provide a foundational understanding of working with databases using SQL, particularly in the context of MySQL.
