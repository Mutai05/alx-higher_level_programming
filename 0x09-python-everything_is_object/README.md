Python's awesomeness stems from its simplicity, versatility, and readability. Here are some answers to your other questions:

### Objects:
An object in Python is a data structure that contains data (attributes) and code (methods/functions) that operate on the data. Everything in Python is an object, whether it's a number, string, list, or even functions and classes.

### Class vs. Object/Instance:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. An object or instance is a specific realization of a class. You create an object by instantiating a class.

### Immutable vs. Mutable Objects:
Immutable objects, like tuples and strings, cannot be modified after creation. Any operation that appears to modify them actually creates a new object. Mutable objects, such as lists and dictionaries, can be changed after creation. Their contents can be modified without changing their identity (memory location).

### Reference:
In Python, a reference is a value that points to an object in memory. Variables in Python are references to objects rather than containers for objects. When you create a variable and assign it a value, you're creating a reference to an object in memory.

### Assignment:
Assignment in Python involves binding a name (variable) to a value (object). It associates the name with the object and allows you to use the name to access that object.

### Alias:
An alias refers to multiple names (variables) referencing the same object. Changing the object through one name will affect the object when accessed through the other name because they point to the same memory location.

### Identical Variables:
Two variables are identical if they refer to the same object in memory. This can be checked using the `is` operator: `a is b`.

### Checking if Variables are Linked to the Same Object:
You can check if two variables are linked to the same object using the `id()` function. If `id(a)` equals `id(b)`, they refer to the same object.

### Displaying Variable Identifier (Memory Address in CPython):
You can use the `id()` function to get the memory address of an object: `id(variable)`. In CPython, you'll get the memory address of the object.

### Mutable and Immutable:
Mutable objects can be changed after creation, while immutable objects cannot be modified. Mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and sets, while immutable objects include tuples, strings, and frozensets.

### Built-in Mutable Types:
Some built-in mutable types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

### Built-in Immutable Types:
Built-in immutable types in Python include tuples, strings, and frozensets.

### Passing Variables to Functions:
Python passes variables to functions by passing references to objects. If the object is mutable and modified within the function, the changes will affect the original object. If the object is immutable, any modifications within the function will create a new object, leaving the original unchanged.
