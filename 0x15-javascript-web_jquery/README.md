jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. It allows developers to write shorter and cleaner code compared to traditional JavaScript, thanks to its concise syntax and powerful methods.

To use jQuery in your web project, you typically include the jQuery library in your HTML file. You can either download jQuery and include it locally or use a content delivery network (CDN) to include it from a remote server. Here's how you can include jQuery using a CDN:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>jQuery Example</title>
    <!-- Include jQuery from CDN -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, jQuery!</h1>
    <button id="myButton">Click me</button>

    <script>
        // jQuery code can go here
        $(document).ready(function() {
            // This code will run when the document is ready
            $('#myButton').click(function() {
                alert('Button clicked!');
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, we include jQuery from a CDN by adding a `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to the jQuery library hosted on the jQuery CDN. 

After including jQuery, we can write jQuery code inside `<script>` tags. In this example, we use jQuery's `$(document).ready()` function to ensure that the code inside it runs only after the DOM has finished loading. Inside this function, we attach a click event handler to the button with the id `myButton`. When this button is clicked, an alert will pop up with the message "Button clicked!".

This is just a basic example to get you started with jQuery. jQuery provides many more methods and features for DOM manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX interactions, which you can explore further in its documentation.
